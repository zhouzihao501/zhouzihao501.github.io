Hi! I am a CS PhD student at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) and [Xi’an Jiaotong-liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), beginning from 2022 Fall. 
My supervisory team includes [Prof. Qiufeng Wang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/QiufengWang), [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage/home) and [Prof. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/).

My research interests lie in:
*  __Large Language Models Reasoning__: Evaluating and improving the reasoning ability of LLMs, particularly in math solving ability.
*  __Mathematical Question Answering__ : Math word problem, Geometry problem, etc. 
*  __Dialog tutoring System__: Exploring how to build tutoring system like real teacher.
