Hi, I am a CS PhD student at [Xi’an Jiaotong-liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) and [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), beginning from 2022 Fall. 
My supervisory team includs [Qiufeng Wang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/departments/academic-departments/electrical-and-electronic-engineering/staff/qiufeng-wang), [Kaizhu Huang](http://www.premilab.com/KaizhuHUANG.ashx), [Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/) and [Wei Wang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/zh/staff-details/staff/wei-wang03).
My research interests lie in __Natural Language Processing__, __Mathmatical Question Answering__, __Large Language Models Reasoning__, __Dialog tutoring System__, etc.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or want to discuss relevant research topic or potential collaborations.
