Hi! I am a CS PhD student at [Xi’an Jiaotong-liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en) and [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), beginning from 2022 Fall. 
My supervisory team includes [Prof. Qiufeng Wang](http://www.premilab.com/QiufengWANG.ashx), [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](http://www.premilab.com/KaizhuHUANG.ashx) and [Prof. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/).
Recently, I am a visiting student at Tsinghua University, working in [KEG lab](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in:
*  __Mathmatical Question Answering__ : Math word problem, Geometry problem, etc. 
*  __Large Language Models Reasoning__: Evaluating and improving the reasoning ability of LLMs, particularly in math solving ability.
*  __Dialog tutoring System__: Exploring how to build tutoring system like real teacher.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or want to discuss relevant research topic or potential collaborations!
