Hi! I am a CS PhD student at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) and [Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong-liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en), beginning from 2022 Fall. 

My research interests lie in:
*  __Large Language Models Reasoning__: Evaluating and improving the reasoning ability of LLMs, particularly in math solving ability.
*  __Mathematical Question Answering__ : Math word problem, Geometry problem, etc. 
*  __Dialog tutoring System__: Exploring how to build tutoring system like real teacher.
